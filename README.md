We are currently looking for a local partner in Europe.

I lead a small software development team, and we are planning to expand our business into the European market. However, some clients prefer to work with developers who are located in Europe, which presents a challenge for us.

To address this, I would like to collaborate with a European partner. Your role would be to allow us to operate through your Freelancer.com account, while we handle all technical development and project delivery. You would manage payments and, when necessary, communicate with clients. 
If you have a technical background, you are also welcome to contribute your skills to the business.

In return, we will share 10–15% of the monthly income generated. This is not a traditional salary, but an equity-style partnership based on a percentage of revenue.

If this opportunity interests you, please feel free to contact me so we can discuss the details further.
